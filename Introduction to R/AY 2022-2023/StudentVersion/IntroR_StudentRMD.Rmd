## Introduction and Icebreakers

First and foremost, I would like to give a big thank you to everyone for coming! Hosting a bridge program like this has been an idea of mine for almost a full year now, and I am so happy that I have been given the opportunity. Of course, this course would not be possible without standing on the shoulders of a number of giants. The majority of this short course was _not_ written by me. Rather it was carefully developed, iterated upon,  re-iterated upon, and given quality changes for the past 4+ years. Without the diligence and hard work of Sara Manheimer, Harley Clifton, Eliot Liucci, Greta Linse, and Mark Greenwood, none of this would have possible. I have merely added a few minor sections, shifted around some emphasis, and changed the flow of the course to accomodate what would be typical of a bridge program / short course. 


The goal of this short course is to get everyone acquainted with some of the fundamentals of `R`, and to make sure that everyone has the tools that they need to succeed in their first year of graduate school. Before we get into a discussion of `R` though, we are going to get to know each other a little bit!
Before we get started on talking about R, we are going to get to know each other a little bit. Our first order of business is to go around the room and introduce ourselves. Let's all say our...

- Your name:
- Your preferred pronouns:
- What you hope to get out of this short course:
- Something fun that you did this summer:

Now that we have some essential information on everyone, we can do a couple of icebreakers! I have never been a fan of the classic "go around the room and answer some additional icebreaker questions", so we're going to try something that I picked up from a conference this summer! Here's how it's going to work: Everyone is going to stand up, and  I will give a statement. If you strongly agree, you will stand more towards the right of the room. If you strongly disagree, you will stand more towards the left of the room. And if you're somewhere in the middle, you'll stand... somewhere in the middle! Here's an example:

1. I have a very common name

Of course, I ended up all the way on the right side of the room! Now that we have some understanding of the activities, let's give them a try.

2. I can be a career statistician without any programming background

3. I am a good `R` programmer

4. I want to get better at programming in `R`

## So What Will We Talk About?

The term `R` is used to refer to both the programming language as well as the 
software that interprets the scripts written using it. The learning curve may be
steeper than with other statistical software, but with `R` the results of your 
analysis or your plot does not rely on remembering what order you clicked on 
things, but instead on the written commands you generated. In `R` you will work
in scripts or with dynamic documents, with scripts within them (Rmd or Rnw files). 
Scripts may feel strange at first, but they make the steps you used in your 
analysis clear for both you and for someone who wants to give you feedback, 
further promoting the importance of reproducible science!  

RStudio is a free computer application that allows you access to the resources 
of `R`, while providing you with a comfortable working environment. There are 
many ways you can interact with `R`, but for many reasons RStudio has become 
the most popular. To function correctly, RStudio uses `R` behind the scenes, 
hence both need to be installed on your computer. Both `R` and `RStudio` are 
cross-platform, so that everyone's versions look and operate the same regardless
of their operating system! 

For this workshop, we will be making use of the RStudio that you will need to install on your computer. For more details on this, you have hopefully completed the steps discussed here https://greenwood-stat.shinyapps.io/InstallDemo_RWorkshops/. The short version for downloading is to first go to https://cloud.r-project.org/ to get `R` installed and then go to https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ to install RStudio.

You need to have a computer that is running Linux, Windows, or a somewhat recent macOS. Unfortunately, a Chromebook or iPad are not sufficient for installing and running R.

However you get to it, RStudio has four possible panels, where each can be viewed at the same time and
has multiple tabs available.  

- the __Editor__ for your scripts and documents (top-left)  
- the `R` __Console__ (bottom-left)  
- your __Environment (Objects/Variables)/History__ (top-right)  
- and your __Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer__ (bottom-right).

![RStudio layout](./images/rstudio.png)  

You can use the Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance tab to modify the colors and font sizes in RStudio.

## Working in `R`  

The document we provided for you is an Rmarkdown (.Rmd) document. It allows you to work in a reproducible fashion, with both code (placed in what are called code chunks) and descriptions of results in the same file. The grey sections that have three single quotes then `{r}` will delineate a code chunk. 

````
```{r}`r ''`
1 + 1
```  
````


You can add these with Insert -> `R` into a .Rmd file. Type all of your code in these code chunks and other documentation and interpretation of results outside of the code chunks (like we are doing here). Although there are more complex ways to work in RStudio, you should start today with saving this .Rmd  file into a folder that also contains any data and other figures you might want to read into this document. When you do that, RStudio will know where to look to read in the data so you do not need to know the path for its physical location on your computer. Once we are done with our local work, we can also use the `Knit` button to compile our work into HTML, Word (DOCX), or PDF documents. We will demonstrate this at the end of the workshop - but this will only work if all the code "runs" and what we have provided you has some errors in it. One other great feature in these files is that it does live spell-checknig - I mean spell-checking - by underlining suspect words. We will also discuss RStudio "Projects" that take this one step further in terms of organizing your work built around this markdown framework. It is important to understand the various ways to do your work in R using RStudio. 

RStudio allows for you to execute commands directly from the code chunk in the 
document by using the __Ctrl + Enter__ (on Macs, __Cmd + Return__) shortcut. If
you place your cursor on the line in the code chunk that you would like to run 
and hit this shortcut, `R` will execute that line(s) of code for you. 
Alternatively, you can also execute code in the console (where the output of the
commands pops up). The difference between running code in the console and in the
document is that any code you execute in the console will be lost once you close
your `R` session. If you type code into the document's code chunks, it will be 
saved when you close your `R` session. Because we want to be able to go back and
re-run our code after today's workshop, it is better to type the command we want
`R` to run in the document and save it!

If `R` is ready to accept commands, the `R` console (in the bottom-left) will 
show a `>` prompt. When `R` receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting, or 
using the shortcut), it will execute it, and when finished will display the 
results and show the `>` symbol once again. If `R` is still waiting for you to 
provide it with additional instructions, a `+` will appear in the console. 
This should tell you that you didn't finish your command. You could have 
forgotten to close your parenthesis or a quotation. If this happens and you are
unsure of what went wrong, click inside the console and hit the `Esc` key. 
Then you can start over and figure out where you went wrong!

### Calculator  

__Practice__: Enter each of the following commands and confirm that the response
is the correct answer.  Try to do this in the console and by executing the code in the code chunk, both line by line and all at once.

```{r}  
1 + 2 

16*9

sqrt(2)
```

## Creating Objects 

These operations, however, are not very interesting. To do more useful things in
`R`, we need to assign values to an object. To create an object, we tell `R` the
object's name, followed by an assignment arrow (`<-`), and finally the value of 
the object. This would look something like this:

`x <- 6`

Once we execute/run this line of code, we notice that a new object appears in 
our environment window. This window shows all of the objects that you have 
created during your `R` session. The value of `x` appears next to it, since it 
is a scalar. 

__Remarks:__  

* In the above code `<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the 
right to objects on the left. So, after executing `year <- 6`, the value of 
`year` is `6`. The arrow can be read as `6` goes into `year`. For historical reasons,
you can also use = for assignments, but not in every context. Because of the 
slight differences in syntax, it is best practice to always use `<-` for 
assignments.  

    + In RStudio, typing Alt at the same time as the - key will write `<-` in a 
    single keystroke. Neat! (Option + - on MacOS)

* There are a few simple rules that apply when creating the same of a new object
(like we did above):  

    + `R` is case sensitive, so if you name your variable `cat` but then try to 
    run the code `Cat + 2`, you will get an error saying that `Cat` does not exist  
    + You also want your object's name to be explanatory, but not too long. 
    Think `current_temperature` verses `current_temp`. Do you really want to 
    type out temperature every time?  
    + Finally, you cannot begin any object's name with a number. You can end a 
    name with a number (e.g. clean_data2), but does that give you much 
    information about what is in the contents of `clean_data2` relative to 
    `clean_data`?    
    + The name cannot contain any punctuation symbols, except for `.` and `_` 
    (`.` is not recommended)  
    + You should not name your object the same as any common functions you may 
    use (`mean`, `sd,` etc.)  
    
* Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your 
future self and your collaborators. 


## Working with Objects 

When you assign a value to an object (like we did previously) `R` does not output
anything by default. Writing the name of the object will output the value of the object you created. 

```{r}
x <- 6

x

```

Once the object has been created, you can use it! Run the following lines of code:

```{r}
2.2 * x

4 + x 

```

We can also overwrite an object's value, so that it has a new value. In the code
below create a new object `y` and then we give `x` a new value of 2. 

```{r}
y <-  x + 6

x <- 2 

```

### Exercise 1:

What is the current value of `y`? 12 or 8? Create a code chunk (Hint, use __Ctrl + Alt + I__ on Windows, or __Cmd + Option + I__ on Mac, to insert a blank `R` code chunk) and write the code to display the value of the object.  

```{r exercise1, exercise = TRUE}
x <- 6

y <-  x + 6

x <- 2 

## your code goes here!
```

## Working with Different Data Types 

A vector is the basic data type in `R`. A vector is a series of values, which 
can be either numbers or characters, but every entry of the vector must be the 
same data type. `R` can tell that you are building a vector when you use the 
`c()` function, which concatenates a series of entries together. 

```{r}
temps <- c(50, 55, 60, 65)
temps
```

To make a vector of characters, you are required to use quotation marks (" ") to 
indicate to `R` that the value you are using is not an object you already 
created in `R`. 

```{r}
animals <- c("cat", "dog", "bird", "fish")
animals
```

Important features of a vector is the type of data they store. Run the following
lines of code and decide what type of data the vectors contain. 

```{r}
class(temps)

class(animals)
```

### Exercise 2:

Create a vector, named `dec`, that contains three decimal valued numbers. Then check what data type does that vector contain?

```{r exercise2, exercise = TRUE}
# Exercise 2 code here!
```

Another possible data type is a logical (Boolean) value. This type of data  
takes on values of `TRUE` and `FALSE`. But, we said that vectors could only be 
numbers or characters. If `TRUE` and `FALSE` don't have quotations around them,
then they aren't characters. So, then they must be numbers. What numbers do you 
think they are?  

```{r}
logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

class(logic)
```

### Exercise 3:

What happens when we try to mix different data types into one 
vector? Speculate what will happen when we run each of the following lines of code. How do you check what type the vectors are? But first, you should try to build some intuition and think about what types they might be.

```{r exercise3, exercise = TRUE}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")

num_logic <- c(1, 2, 3, FALSE)

char_logic <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)

guess <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```


In each of these vectors, the two types of data were *coerced* into a single 
data type. This happens in a hierarchy, where some data types get preference 
over others. Can we draw a diagram of the hierarchy?  

## Lists  

While the elements of vectors have to be of the same data type, a list is a
special vector in `R` that allows for you to store a variety of types of 
objects. If you have a vector, a matrix, and/or a character, you can store all of them
into one list object!

The arguments to the list function are the components of the list, where the 
components can be characters, vectors, matrices, or other data structures. 
Here, we create a list whose components are the three vectors we've been 
working with:

```{r}
my_first_list <- list(animals, temps, logic)
my_first_list

my_first_list[[1]]
```

We notice that when printing a list, the output looks a bit different. There 
are a whole bunch of brackets! Let's break them down. I like to think of a list
as a shelf with cubby holes. The cubby holes are the components of the list, 
but there are elements in each cubby.  

* To get to a specific component (cubby) of a list, you use the double brackets
next to the name of the list (e.g `my_first_list[[1]]`).  
* To access the elements inside each cubby, you then use single square brackets 
(e.g. `my_first_list[[1]][2]`). 

![Example of lists](./images/list_example.png)

### Named Lists

```{r}
my_named_list <- list(title = "statistics", 
                      numbers = 1:10,
                      data = TRUE)
my_named_list
```

We see the output for a named list is slightly different. Instead of double 
brackets next to each component, there are now `$` and names of the variable. 
This will help you understand the structure of data.frames (coming up next)!

## Importing Data  

* Use the __Import Dataset__ button in the __Environment__ tab  
* Choose the __From Text (base)__ option  
* Click on the __Browse__ button  
* Direct the computer to where you saved the `BlackfootFish.csv` data file, click __open__  
* It will bring up a preview of the data 
* Make sure that the box labeled "Strings as factors" is not checked 
* Click on the __Import__ button  

Notice the code that outputs in the console (the bottom left square). This is 
the code that you could have typed in the code chunk below to import the data 
yourself. Copy and paste the code that was output in the code chunk below.  

```{r}
# copy and paste the code that was used by R to import the data 
# be careful to only copy the code that is next to the > signs! 
 BlackfootFish <- read.csv("BlackfootFish.csv")

```

The path provided can also be simplified to just include the file name - if the .Rmd and data are saved in the same folder. If you have any trouble reading in the data set, here is code that allows you to read the data from our github repository:

```{r}
BlackfootFish <- read.csv("https://github.com/saramannheimer/data-science-r-workshops/raw/master/Introduction%20to%20R/AY%202020-2021/Student%20Version/BlackfootFish.csv")
```

In general, we can always use the `read.csv` or `read_csv` commands in order to read in datasets. This will be an important skill for us moving forwards, because without being able to read in data, it is difficult to do our job as statisticians!

## Structure of Data  

The data we will use is organized into data tables. When you imported the 
BlackfootFish data into RStudio it was saved as an object. You are able to inspect
the structure of the BlackfootFish object using functions built in to `R` 
(no packages necessary).  

Run the following code. What is output from each of the following commands?

```{r}
class(BlackfootFish) ## What is the object class of the data?

dim(BlackfootFish) ## What is the first number represent? What about the second number?

names(BlackfootFish) ## What does this output refer to?

str(BlackfootFish) ## What is the structure of the data?
```

 
```{r}
summary(BlackfootFish) ## What is the data type of each variable in our dataset?

typeof(BlackfootFish) ## What is the storage mode of a data.frame?
```

When we inspect dataframes, or other objects in `R`, there are some general 
functions that are useful to check the content/structure of the data. 
Here are some:

- size:  
    + `dim(datasetname)`: rows and columns  
    + `nrow(datasetname)`: number of rows  
    + `ncol(datasetname)`: number of columns  
    + `length(datasetname$variable)`: length of a vector


- content:  
    + `head(datasetname)`: first 6 rows  
    + `tail(datasetname)`: last 6 rows  
    + `View(datasetname)`: opens viewer window in separate tab  
    

- names:  
    + `colnames(datasetname)`: column names of dataframe  
    + `rownames(datasetname)`: row names of dataframe  


- summary of content:  
    + `str(datasetname)`: structure of object and information about the columns  
    + `glimpse(datasetname)`: similar information to `str`, but neater output (requires `tibble` package)  
    + `summary(datasetname)`: summary statistics for each column  
  
*Note:* Many of these are generic functions that will work on other data types, 
not just on `data.frame`s. 

## Dataframes 

What is a dataframe? A dataframe is a type of `R` object and is the *de facto* 
structure of tabular data. You can create dataframes by hand, but most of us do 
not use `R` to input our data by hand. Instead, we import our data using `R` 
commands that read in spreadsheets (`read.csv`, `read_csv` (requires `readr` package), `read_excel` (requires `readxl` package), etc.). A dataframe is a set of columns, where each column is a vector. Thus, columns 
have the same data type *within* the column, but potentially different data 
types *across* columns. 

For example, the columns `trip`, `mark`, and `year` are integers (whole numbers),
`weight` and `length` are numeric (numbers with decimals), and `section` and 
`species` are characters. 

## Extracting Data  

If we were interested in accessing a specific variable in our dataset, we can 
use the `$` command. This command extracts the specified variable (on the right
of the `$` sign) from the dataset. When this is extracted, `R` views the variable
as a vector of entries, which is what the [1:18352] refers to.

```{r}  
years <- BlackfootFish$year 
## extracts year from the dataset and saves it into a new variable named years

str(years) ## using the new variable (remember case matters!)

## How would you determine how long the vector is?

```

Another method for accessing data in the dataset is using matrix notation 
([row, column]). If you look to your right in the __Environment__ window, you 
notice that RStudio tells you the dimensions of the BlackfootFish data. You can 
(roughly) view the dataset as a matrix of entries, with variable names for each 
of the columns. I could instead use bracket notation to perform the same task as
above, using the following code.  

```{r}  
years <- BlackfootFish[, 5] 
## This takes ALL rows of data but only the fifth column
## Same as years <- BlackfootFish[1:18352, 5]

BlackfootFish[1, 5]

str(years)
```

### Practice: Working with dataframes

The following is a preview of the dataframe `df`: 

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = c("H", "N", "T", "W", "V"), 
  y = c("May", "Oct", "Mar", "Aug", "Feb"),
  z = c(2010, 2015, 2018, 2017, 2019)
  )

df
```

#### Exercise 4:

What would be output if you entered: `df[3, ]`?   

```{r exercise4, exercise = TRUE}
## your code here
```

#### Exercise 5:

What would you input to get an output of `2015`? Can you 
think of two ways to do it?

```{r exercise5, exercise = TRUE}
## your code goes here!
```

#### Exercise 6:

How would you pull off only columns `x` and `y`? What about 
pulling off only columns `x` and `z`?

```{r exercise6, exercise = TRUE}
## your code here!
```

#### Exercise 7:

How would you modify the script below, to get an output 
of `[1] 22 24`? 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
s <- c(22, 24, 49, 18, 1, 6)
s[]

```

```{r exercise7, exercise = TRUE}
s <- c(22, 24, 49, 18, 1, 6)

## your code here!
```

#### Exercise 8:

See what would happen if you entered `s[3, ]`. How can you explain that result?  

```{r exercise8, exercise = TRUE}
## enter code here. what do you think will happen?
```

## Changing Data Type  

By default, when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain 
characters (i.e., text) are coerced (= converted) into factors. Depending on what
you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these columns as character. 
To do so, read.csv() and read.table() have an argument called `stringsAsFactors` 
which can be set to FALSE. This is what happened when we made sure that the box "stringsAsFactors" was unchecked when importing our data. 

In most cases, it is preferable to set stringsAsFactors = FALSE when importing 
data and to convert as a factor only the columns that require this data type. 
But what is a factor? 

Consider the variables species and section. These variables represent a
broader class of what we call categorical variables. In `R` there are two ways 
to store this information, (1) as a series of `character` strings, or (2) as a 
`factor`. In the early days of coding in `R`, factors were more efficient than 
characters, since you only need to store the level of the factor each 
observation went with. 

Some functions in R require character vectors to be converted to factor variables to correctly handle the information. We recommend that you convert character vectors to factors and always review and possibly modify the levels of the factor variable to make the levels as explicit as possible. 

In these data, species has
four levels (RBT, WCT, Bull, and Brown). The levels are the unique values that variable can take on. If we want `R` to view this variable
as a factor instead of character, we need to change its data type.   

```{r factors, purl = TRUE}  
unique(BlackfootFish$species) ## tells you the unique values of species

BlackfootFish$speciesF <- factor(BlackfootFish$species) 
## creates a new variable that is the factor version of species

```

There is also a function that will allow for you to specify the order of the 
levels of a factor! As we saw before, the `factor` function chooses the 
levels alphabetically. Suppose you would like for the species to be in the 
following order: Bull, Brown, RBT, and WCT. 

Using the `factor` function this would look like:

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
BlackfootFish$speciesF <- factor(BlackfootFish$species, 
                                levels = c("Bull", "Brown", "RBT", "WCT"))
```

If you want to check the order and names of the levels that are being used by a factor, the `levels()` function can be useful:

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
levels(BlackfootFish$speciesF)

```

### Practice: Working with factor variables 

#### Exercise 9:

Year was saved as an integer data type (1989 - 2006), but we 
may want to consider it to be a categorical variable (a factor). Write the `R` 
code to create a new variable called `yearF` that is a factor of `year` 
(as you did with section and species). 

```{r exercise9, exercise = TRUE}
## exercise 9 code here
```

#### Exercise 10:

Now, verify that `yearF` is viewed as a categorical variable, 
with the same levels as `year`. (hint: you have already used three functions 
that would do this for you)  

```{r exercise10, exercise = TRUE}
## your code here
```

An issue with factors lies with if/when you want to change it back to a 
number or character. In the code below I've decided that I don't want year 
to be a factor and want to change it back to numeric. What happens when I use 
the `as.numeric()` function on the `yearF` variable?  

```{r}
BlackfootFish$yearF <- factor(BlackfootFish$year)
```

```{r}
year_recover <- as.numeric(BlackfootFish$yearF)

ds <- data.frame(original = BlackfootFish$yearF, 
                 recovered = year_recover)
head(ds)

tail(ds)

```

## Packages  

As we mentioned previously, `R` has many packages, which people around the world
work on to provide and maintain new software and new capabilities for `R`. 
You will slowly accumulate a number of packages that you use often for a variety
of purposes. In order to use the elements (data, functions) of the packages, you
have to first install the package (only once on a given computer) and then load the package (every time).  

We're going to install a few packages that are often used.  

* Use the __Install__ button in the __Packages__ tab  
* Type in `remotes` and `tidyverse` into the blank line (separated by a comma)  
* Check the __Install dependencies__ box  
* Click on the __Install__ button  

There will be a large amount of output coming out of the console. This output is
`R` trying to download the package(s) you requested. Once the computer has downloaded the packages, it will tell you that 
"`The downloaded binary packages are in`", followed by the location of the files.  

Now that the files are downloaded, we need to load them in order to use them. 
The following code will load each package, please run it!  

```{r packages}
library(remotes)
library(tidyverse)
```

Notice that when loading the `tidyverse` package that there is a large amount of
output. This output is telling you all of the other packages that are loaded in 
the `tidyverse` package, as well as the functions in the `tidyverse` package
that overwrite (mask) functions from base `R`.  

This is the process you go through if you ever find packages that you would 
like to use! Often packages that you install will need to be updated. To update
a package you can click on the "Tools" tab, then click on "Check for Package
Updates". This will bring up a window that will list all of the packages that 
have newer versions than what you have. Click on the packages that you wish to 
update, or click on the "Select All" button.

## Finding Help  

One of the chief reasons for `R`'s religious following is its wonderful 
documentation. If you need a function to complete a task (say find the variance), but are not quite sure how it's spelled, what arguments it takes, or what package
it lives in, don't fret! The `?` and `help()` commands are very powerful. For 
functions, placing the `?` before the name, will tell `R` to search for that 
name in all of the functions, in all of the packages you have installed.  

* If it finds _one_ __identical match__, it will display the help file for that 
function in the Help tab in the bottom-right corner.  
* If it finds _more than one_ __identical match__, it will display the functions,
in their respective packages, that you have to choose from.  
* If it finds _no_ __identical match__, it will tell you that "`No documentation 
for ____ in specified packages and libraries:,`" and suggests you use a `??` 
instead.  
    
    + A `??` in front of the function name will search __all of `R`__ for named 
    functions similar to what you typed.  
    + The output will tell you what package the function is in, as well as the 
    function's name (`package::function`).  

If you would like help on a particular package, say one that you just downloaded,
then you can use the same command(s) to get help.  These commands will load up 
a help page (in RStudio) in the Help pane. Each help page is broken down into 
sections:  

* Description: An extended description of what the function does.   
* Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values.     
* Arguments: An explanation of the object each argument is expecting.  
* Details: Any important details to be aware of.    
* Value: The object the function returns.      
* See Also: Any related functions that may be useful.    
* Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

## Functions  

In `R` there are both functions that are built in (require no package to be 
loaded), as well as functions that are housed within specific packages. You have
already used a few built in functions to inspect the structure of the 
BlackfootFish data (`str`, `class`, `summary`). As we know, a function 
transforms an input (potentially multiple) into an output. You have to provide
`R` with the inputs (arguments) required for the function to generate an output.
The argument(s) inside a function happen after the `(` symbol. You know an 
object is a function when it is immediately followed by a  `(` and the 
corresponding closing `)` comes after the arguments are complete. The output of 
a function does not have to be numerical and it typically is not a single 
number, it can be a set of things or a dataset.   

Arguments describe the details of what a function is to do. Some functions take 
arguments that are specified by the user, or, if left undeclared, take on 
default values. These arguments are typically given names (as seen in the help
file), but the arguments are assumed to follow the order the function 
expects if they are not named (also stated in the help file). When naming an 
argument, the name of the argument is followed by an `=` sign and then the value
of the argument. Notice that here we are using the `=` to declare what value 
each argument is taking on, we **are not** creating a new variable with that 
value assigned to it.   

Suppose we wanted to create a vector of 10 zeros. To do this, we would use the `rep` function:  

```{r} 
# ?rep

rep(x = 0, times = 10) ## repeating 0 ten times

rep(times = 10, 0) ## switching order of arguments

rep(0, 10) ## no named arguments

rep(10, 0) ## not what we wanted!
```

Now let's look over some other functions that are often used: 


```{r} 

mean(BlackfootFish$weight)  ## takes a numerical input, but there are NA's in our data

mean(BlackfootFish$weight, argument here! )  ## review the help and add in the argument that removes the NA's

median(BlackfootFish$species) ## gives an error because the input is not the correct data type  

cor(BlackfootFish$length, BlackfootFish$weight) ## takes multiple inputs separated by a comma

## Does cor have an option to remove NA's?
```

As seen in the functions above, some functions have *optional* arguments. If 
they are not specified by the user, then they take on their default value 
(`FALSE` for `na.rm`). These options control the behavior of the functions, 
such as whether it includes/excludes NA values. 

## Cleaning Data  

In many instances, you will deal with data that are not "clean". Based on the 
output we received from the `mean()` function, we know that there are NA's in 
the BlackfootFish data, possibly across a variety of variables. Before we used 
`na.rm` as an option to remove NA's *within* a function, but the `na.omit` 
function takes a dataframe and removes any NA's from that dataset. Based on the
output below, how many rows in the BlackfootFish data have an NA present?  

```{r}

dim(BlackfootFish) ## gives the dimensions of the dataset in (row, column) format  

dim(na.omit(BlackfootFish)) 

## na.omit takes dataframes, matricies, and vectors and returns object with incomplete cases removed 
## incomplete cases are ones with any NA's
```

__Remark:__ The computer is using an algorithm to return a dataset with no NA 
values anywhere in it. This algorithm goes through every row of the dataset and
(roughly) has the following steps,  

* Inspect the row to see if there is an NA anywhere in that row  
* If there is an NA in that row, the logical (`is.na`) evaluates to TRUE, and 
the row is deleted  
* If there are not any NA's in that row, the logical evaluates to FALSE, and the 
row is retained  
* Once it has stepped through every row, the function outputs the "cleaned" 
dataframe

If we wish to remove all of the NA's from the dataset, we can use the 
`na.omit` command from above. We can save the new "clean" dataset under a new name
(creating a new object) or under the same name as before (replacing the old 
object with the new object).

```{r}
BlackfootFish_clean <- na.omit(BlackfootFish) 
## Creates a new dataframe, where the NA's have all been removed 
```

## Data Visualization  

There are many different genres of data graphics, with many different variations
on each genre. Here are some commonly encountered kinds:  

* __scatterplots__: showing relationships between two quantitative variables    
* __distributions__: showing distributions of a single quantitative variable      
* __bar charts__: displaying frequencies or densities of a single categorical 
variable  

### Scatterplots

The main purpose of the scatterplot is to show the relationship between two 
variables across several or many cases. Most often, there is a Cartesian 
coordinate system in which the x-axis represents one variable and the y-axis the
second variable.  

```{r}
#?plot()
plot(length ~ weight, 
     data = BlackfootFish_clean) 

```

```{r}
plot(length ~ weight, 
     data = BlackfootFish_clean, 
     xlab = "Weight (gm)", ## adding in axis labels
     ylab = "Length (cm)", 
     las = 1, ## changing orientation of y-axis labels,
     main = "Plot of Length by Weight of ..." ## adds a title
     ) 
```

### Distribution

A histogram shows how many observations fall into a given range of values of a 
variable and can be used to visualize the distribution of a single quantitative variable.  

```{r}
hist(BlackfootFish_clean$length) 
```

```{r}
hist(BlackfootFish_clean$length, 
     freq = F) ## converts to a density plot (area adds to 1) 
```


```{r}
## Does freq need to be named?
hist(BlackfootFish_clean$length, FALSE)
## Why is there an error about the "number of breaks"?

```

```{r}
hist(BlackfootFish_clean$length, 
     freq = F, 
     xlab = "Length", ## adds x-axis label 
     main = "Fish Lengths in Blackfoot River" ## adds title to plot
     ) 
```

```{r}
hist(BlackfootFish_clean$length, 
     freq = F, 
     nclass = 50, ## changes the number of bins 
     xlab = "Length", 
     main = "Fish Lengths in the Blackfoot River", 
     las = 1 ## changes orientation of axis labels
     ) 
```

### Side-by-Side Boxplots  

The familiar boxplot is a simple display to use when the objective is to compare the 
distribution of a quantitative variable across different levels of a categorical
variable. 

```{r} 
## What other options are available to add to your boxplot?
boxplot(weight ~ species, 
        data = BlackfootFish_clean)
```

### Bar Charts  

Bar charts are an effective way to compare the frequencies of levels of a 
categorical variable. 

```{r}
section <- table(BlackfootFish_clean$section)
## tables the number of fish that were caught in each section

barplot(section, 
        xlab = "Section", ## adds axis labels to plot 
        ylab = "Number of Fish", 
        main = "Fish Caught by Section", ## adds title to plot
        las = 1, ## changes orientation of axis labels
        col = "blue", ## specifies what color the bars should be
        ylim = c(0, 12000) ## specifies what range of y-values to plot
        )
```

### Practice: Graphing

#### Exercise 11:

Using statistics or graphics, which year in our dataset had the 
most fish caught?  

```{r exercise11, exercise = TRUE}
BlackfootFish <- read.csv("https://github.com/saramannheimer/data-science-r-workshops/raw/master/Introduction%20to%20R/AY%202020-2021/Student%20Version/BlackfootFish.csv")
BlackfootFish_clean <- na.omit(BlackfootFish)
```

```{r exercise11-solution}
BlackfootFish <- read.csv("https://github.com/saramannheimer/data-science-r-workshops/raw/master/Introduction%20to%20R/AY%202020-2021/Student%20Version/BlackfootFish.csv")
BlackfootFish_clean <- na.omit(BlackfootFish)

year <- table(BlackfootFish_clean$year)

barplot(year, 
        xlab = "year", ## adds axis labels to plot 
        ylab = "Number of Fish", 
        main = "Fish Caught by Year", ## adds title to plot
        las = 1, ## changes orientation of axis labels
        col = "blue", ## specifies what color the bars should be
        ylim = c(0, 12000) ## specifies what range of y-values to plot
        )
```


#### Exercise 12:

Make a boxplot of the fish weights over the different years in 
the dataset.  

```{r}

```

## Knitting/compiling

Hopefully at this point you have fixed all the code errors in the file we initially provided as you learned about the `R` code and functions. A final (and sometimes intermediate step) is to compile your Rmarkdown file into an HTML, Word, or PDF document. The compiling process will verify that the code you wrote works in the order that it is present in the document and is your reproducible result to share with colleagues and collaborators. The .Rmd is your archive of the code used to produce those results from the data.

The HTML format is the least nice for printing but also has the fewest dependencies on other software to compile. Compiling to Word requires a word processing software like Microsoft Word. Compiling to PDF either requires the tinytex package in `R` or a separate installation of miktex, so often requires additional steps beyond what we want to discuss today. 

To attempt to knit to one of these formats, go to "Knit" and click on the triangle to select the "Knit to ..." version. The entire suite of code will be re-run from beginning to end and, if it works, compiled into the document type you specified.

## Exiting RStudio

Finally, when you are done with your work and attempt to exit out of RStudio, it will ask you to save your workspace. **DO NOT DO THIS!** It will just create a cluttered workspace and could even cause you to get incorrect results. In fact, you should go into the Tools -> Global Options and then make sure that "Save workspace to .RData on exit" option on the first screen you will see is set to Never. If you save your `R` code either as a .R or (better) an R Markdown (.Rmd) file, you can re-create any results by simply re-running that code or re-knitting the file. If you find that you have lots of "stuff" in your workspace because you accidentally saved your workspace, just run `rm(list = ls())`. It will delete all the data sets from your workspace.



## Terminology Used in Workshop

* *Command*: A command is what `R` executes. In an `R` script file (script.R), 
commands are automatically implied, as this type of file does not accept text, 
only in comments. In an Rmd (Markdown) file (report.Rmd), commands are 
delineated between three ticks on the top (```` ```{r}````) and three ticks (```` ``` ````) on the
bottom.      

    ````
    ```{r}`r ''`
    # Your code goes here
    ```  
    ````

* *Comment*: Helpful text added into a script environment. Comments can be used
to describe functions, processes, a train of thought, so that when you return to
your code, tomorrow or next year, you are able to understand the purpose of each
line of code! Comments are preceded by at least on `#` within a code chunk. 

* *Object*: A variable created in `R`, to be used elsewhere in the code. Objects
can be a variety of things, such as scalars (`x <- 3`), vectors (`x <- c(1, 2, 3, 
4, 5)`), matrices, and dataframes, to name a few.  

* *Assignment Arrow*: The assignment arrow `<-` is used to assign values on the 
right to the objects on the left (`x <- 1`). For historical reasons, you can also 
use `=` for assignments, but not everywhere. Because of these slight 
differences, it is recommended to *always* use assignment arrows for assignment. 

* *Class*: Most `R` objects have a class attribute, a character vector giving 
the names of the classes from which the object inherits. Examples of classes are
numeric, factor, integer, character, dataframe, matrix, list. 

* *Vector*: A vector is a list of entries, all sharing the same class. A vector 
has only one dimension, so data extraction uses only a single entry in brackets 
(e.g. `x[3]`). You can create vectors of characters (`c("a", "b", "c")`), vectors of 
numbers (`c(1, 2, 3)`), to name a few.

* *Matrix*: Similar to what you may have seen in a mathematics class, a matrix 
is an object with rows and columns, where every entry in the matrix must be a 
number. 

* *List*: A generic vector, which contains other objects. A list can contain a
variety of different classes of objects, e.g., characters, vectors, data.frames, 
matrices, or outputs from a model! A data.frame is a special type of list where
the components are vectors and they all have the same length. 

* *Dataframe*: A dataframe is a collection of variables. Dataframes share many 
of the properties of matrices, where you are able to extract elements using 
bracket (`[]`) notation, and lists, where you are able to extract columns using 
`$`. Dataframes are used as the fundamental data structure by most of `R`'s 
statistical modeling software. Note that tibbles have been more recently created as part of the tidyverse and provide a similar but slightly different object where you can store your data.

* *Argument*: Input(s) into a function, so that an output is created. Most 
functions take named arguments (e.g., `data = BlackfootFish`) and the order of the 
arguments is assumed to follow the order found in the function's help file. When
using a named argument in a function, the name comes first, followed by an `=` 
sign, then the input. 

* *Logical Value*: `TRUE` and `FALSE` value(s) that can be used to turn off/on 
options in functions and plots, and also to manipulate data.

## How to Learn More About `R` and `RStudio`

This material is intended to provide you with an introduction to using `R` for 
scientific analyses of data. The best way for you to continue to learn more 
about `R` is to use it in your research! This may sound daunting, but writing 
`R` scripts is the best way to become familiar with the syntax. This will help 
you progress through more advanced operations, such as cleaning your data, 
using statistical methods, or creating graphics. 

The best place to start is playing around with the code from today's workshop.
Change parts of the code and see what happens! Better yet, use the code from the
workshop to investigate your own data! 

### Clean Code 

Yes, writing code may be completely new to you, but there is a difference between
code that looks nice and code that does not. Generally, object names should be 
nouns and function names should be verbs. It is also important that your code 
looks presentable, so that a friend/college/professor can read it and understand
what you are doing. For these reasons, there are style guides for writing code 
in `R`. The two main style guides are 
\href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml}{Google's} and the slightly 
more comprehensive  
\href{https://style.tidyverse.org/}{Tidyverse style guide}. Installing the `styler` package will allow you to highlight code and format it in a more legible way. Visit \href{https://style.tidyverse.org/}{the tidyverse page} for more.

### Projects in `RStudio`  

`R` projects provide a way to organize all the code and data in one place and many consider these the best way to work in `R`. We chose to avoid this step and just use a single .Rmd file to expedite your first experience using `R`. A motivation for using projects is that it is important to organize your data and script files into the same or related locations and have different locations for different iterations of projects. If you don't do this:

* it is really hard to tell which version of your data is original and what
versions are modified  
* things get really messy because all types of files are mixed together  
* it's probably hard for you to find things and relate the correct files to 
their respective output  

Ultimately, good project organization will make your life easier! It helps 
ensure the integrity of your data, makes it simpler to share your code or get
help with your code, allows for you know exactly what code you used on a 
paper, and it's easier to pick a project back up. 

It is good code writing and file storage practice to keep a set of all related 
data, analysis, plots, documents, etc. in the same folder. RStudio makes this 
process easy with using their projects. In an RStudio project, all of the 
project's pieces are in the same folder. This allows for a clean 
workflow and a simple working directory for `R`. When you are executing code for
a document/script `R` will search for things (such as data) in the 
\underline{same} folder as the document/script, which is called a 
_relative path_.

Whenever you start working on a new project in 
RStudio, go through the following steps:

1. Click on the "File" menu button, then select "New Project"    
2. Click "New Directory"  
3. Click "New Project"  
4. Create a name for your project (make it explanatory!)  
5. Select where the project should live  
6. Click the "Create Project" button  
7. Open the project!

After this process `R` will be searching for objects (such as data) in the 
\underline{same} folder as the project. This allows for us to keep all of our
files in a self-contained system. 
 
After saving your previous work today, you can try to create a project in a new folder on your computer. After you create the project, you can create a new .Rmd file and copy and paste the text from this document into this file. And move a copy of the BlackfootFish.csv into the project folder you created. Whenever you open this project it will take you directly to the work you have done in that project folder. It may be useful to close the project before exiting RStudio to avoid confusion in later sessions.
