These materials were adapted from materials generated by the Data Carpentries (https://datacarpentry.org/) and were originally developed at MSU by Dr. Allison Theobold. The workshop series is co-organized by the Montana State University Library, Department of Mathematical Sciences, and Statistical Consulting and Research Services (SCRS, https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting/). SCRS is supported by Montana INBRE (National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences Grant Number P20GM103474). The workshops for 2021-2022 are supported by Faculty Excellence Grants from MSU's Center for Faculty Excellence.
